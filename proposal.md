# Google Summer of Code 2025 Proposal

## Personal Information

- **Full Name:** Aakash Prasad Chaurasiya  
- **Email Address:** aakashchaurasiya629@gmail.com  
- **GitHub Profile:** [https://github.com/B-TechCode](https://github.com/B-TechCode)  
- **Program:** Google Summer of Code 2025  
- **Organization:** Java PathFinder (JPF Team)  
- **Project Title:** Visualization and Debugging Tool for Java PathFinder (JPF)  
- **Primary Language:** Java  
- **Preferred UI Toolkit:** Swing

---

## Synopsis

Java PathFinder (JPF) is a model checker for Java programs that systematically explores execution paths to detect bugs such as deadlocks, data races, and assertion errors. However, its output is mostly text-based, which makes it challenging to visualize program behavior or understand complex execution paths.

This project aims to develop a Java Swing-based graphical user interface (GUI) that visualizes the internal workings of JPF. It will provide a visual debugger that helps users explore state transitions, error traces, and branching paths, thereby improving usability and accessibility of JPF.

---

## Benefits to the Community

- **Improved Accessibility**: Developers and students can more easily learn and work with JPF.
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Bugs and state errors can be visually traced.
- **Better Adoption**: The GUI will make JPF more attractive for academic and industry use.
- **Reusable Tooling**: The visualization tool can be extended to support other static analysis tools in the future.

## Deliverables

- âœ… Java Swing-based GUI interface for JPF
- âœ… Visual tree/graph representation of program execution states
- âœ… Display of error traces and detected bugs
- âœ… Option to load and step through different executions
- âœ… Documentation and usage guide

## Timeline

### Community Bonding (May 20 - June 16)
- Introduce myself to the JPF community
- Get familiar with JPF core and output format
- Discuss the project architecture with mentors
- Set up local environment and dependencies

### Phase 1 (June 17 - July 15)
- Develop the basic GUI layout in Swing
- Parse JPF outputs into usable data structures
- Visualize execution paths as a tree or flowchart
- Submit mid-term report

### Phase 2 (July 15 - August 12)
- Highlight and navigate through error paths
- Implement side panels for variable/value display
- Add support for viewing thread info and transitions
- Improve interactivity and layout responsiveness

### Final Phase (August 12 - August 17)
- Final testing and bug fixing
- Polish the interface and usability
- Prepare final documentation and video demo
- Submit final evaluation and mentor review
